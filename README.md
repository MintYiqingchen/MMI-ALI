# MMI-ALI:
MMI-ALI is a deep generative model for m-domain joint distribution matching.
We provide 
1. a Pytorch [implementation](https://github.com/MintYiqingchen/MMI-ALI/tree/master/cityscapes) for image translation
2. a Tensorflow [implementation](https://github.com/MintYiqingchen/MMI-ALI/tree/master/mojitalk) for text style transfer
